# Introduction {#intro}

This document outlines the use cases and requirements that guide the specification of a Network Attestation for Secure Routing framework (NASR).

NASR is targeted to help attest to a specific network path and verify if actual forwarding result is compliant to this path. This network path can be both an underlay path consists of physical devices or a virtual path consists of virtual network functions.


## Note for NASR participants

This document collates and synthesizes discussion outcomes of NASR mailing list and IETF 118 path validation side meeting.

It is created to help

  1. Foster consensus among list members.
  2. Orient non-list members to NASR goals and current progress

This document may become a WG-draft but stay informational.

# Use Cases {#usecases}


## Use Case 1: Network Path Validation

Explicit routing protocols permit explicit control over the traffic path, in order to meet certain performance, security or compliance requirements. For example, operators can use SRv6 to orchestrate a Service Function Chaining (SFC) path and provide packaged security services or compliance services. For either of them, validating the actual traffic path in the forwarding plane as an auditing measure is needed for clients and/or authorities. NASR can help operator to attest to an orchestrated path and provide verifiable forwarding proofs to help clients/authorities audit the service.

The network element is not limited to Service Function-- it can also be devices that has certain built-in security capabilities (or other attributes), or workloads. Hence the path is not limited to a SFC path.

## Use Case 2: Verifying Path Properties

In use case 1, The orchestrated path is explicit and specific down to each network element. Sometimes, the client does not need to know every detail. Rather, the clients will request a property at the path level, such as trustworthiness, security level, location, vendor, etc, which is collectively defined by all the elements on the path. The clients will also need a verifiable and non-forgeable proof at the path level, in a collective way. 

Compared to the first use case, the order of the elements may not be important. This use case is more focused on validating the attributes of the path, rather than a very specific ordered path. In other words, make sure that traffic goes trough forwarding elements that comply with required properties.

## Use Case 3: Sensitive Data Routing

Clients from specific industries such as finance, governments have very low tolerance of data leakage. These clients require assurance that their data only travels on top of their selected leased line, MPLS VPN or SD-WAN path, and have (preferably real-time) visibility evidence or proof. Some data protection regulations require that customer data never escape a specific geolocation without explicit permission. To avoid data leakage risks and law compliance risks, some clients are willing to pay a premium for high data routing security guarantees. One of the target of NASR is to provide means to detect such violations so to address them promptly. 

Compared to the first and second use case, this use case requires some preventive measures before a wrongful forwarding takes place, preferably

## Use Case 4: Ingress Filtering


Ingress Filtering techniques, such as uRPF, help prevent source IP address spoofing and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks ({{RFC8704}}, {{RFC5635}}). It works by validating the source IP address of a received packet by performing a reverse path lookup in FIB table, all the way to the source. If the path does not exist, the packet is dropped. NASR can be used to regularly validate the path stored in the FIB table, and tell if it continues to exist. This can potentially reduce the false negative rate. Furthermore, when uRPF is not available and source address cannot be trusted, NASR can offer a way to filter malicious traffic based the path used to carry out such an attack {{Yaar03}}.  



# Requirements {#requirements}

<!-- LUIGI: the NASR Architecture should go in an architectural document. What do you think?
(TBA: To add an architecture diagram integrating below components and show basic interactive flows)
-->

<!-- PCL: Agree -->

Based on the main use-cases described in the previous section the following requirements are identified. 

## Requirement 1: Proof-of-Transit (POT) Mechanisms {#reqpot}

<!-- LUIGI: "DID" is not compliant with RFC 2119 and RFC8174 I've put an highlight marking .. -->
All use cases requested public verifiability of packet transit history. Proof-of-Transit (POT) is a proof that a packet _did_ transit certain network elements. A secure POT mechanism should truthfully reflect the identity of the network element and its attributes. The "attribute" could be different:

<!-- PCL: Accepted your revisions. -->

 - For simple POT, the "attribute" means the path it is on, and its relative position/order on the path. This is the goal of POT mechanism defined in {{-CISCOPOT}}.

 - For richer POT, the "attribute" means it could be a list of attributes: trustworthiness, security capabilities it has, geolocation, vendor, etc. This needs the definition of attributes of a network element, which is discussed in {{reqattributes}}


According to use case 2, the granularity of POT may also differ. POT can be generated and recorded on a per-hop basis, or can be merged into one collective summary in the path level.

The most appropriate POT mechanism for each scenarios may differ-- inter-domain or intra-domain, with or without a pre-attest, per-packet or on-demand, privacy-preserving or not, etc.

[//]: # "Due to similarity of topic, NASR will consult PANRG for usable POT mechanisms and CFRG for reviews."
<!--LUIGI: This last statement has to go in the charter ;-) -->

### Per-hop POT header extensions

POT could be either encapsulated and passed along the original path, or sent out-of-band. It depends on the different operation modes: who should verify the POT (other elements on the path, the end host, or external security operation center (SOC)), timeliness of verification, etc.

When the POT is passed along the path, it should be encapsulated in hop-by-hop header extensions, such as IPv6 hop-by-hop options header, In-situ OAM hop-by-hop option etc. Exact size and specifications of data fields are subject to different POT mechanisms.


### Out-of-band POT extensions

For situations requiring real-time or near-real-time verification, out-of-band methods are needed to encapsulate and transmit POT. For example, traffic monitoring protocols like IPFIX {{RFC7011}}, SNMP, etc. Similarly, exact size and specifications of data fields are subject to different POT mechanisms.

## Requirement 2: Attributes of a network element {#reqattributes}

The identity of a subject should be defined by the attributes (or claims) it owns. Attribute-defined identity is a paradigm widely accepted in SCIM {{RFC7643}}, OAuth {{RFC7519}}, SAML {{SAML2}}, etc. POT proof should reflect the identity and associated attributes, such as element type, security level, security capability it has, remote-attested or not, vendor, deployed geolocation, current timestamp, path it is on, hop index on the path etc.

Such attributes/claims/attestation results can reuse existing specifications, for example {{-RATSEAT}}, {{-RATSRES}} in RATS WG. Some existing claims that we can reuse:

  - hwmodel (Hardware Model)
  - hwversion (Hardware Version)
  - swname (Software Name )
  - swversion (Software Version)
  - location (location)

Some new claim extensions can be made:

    elemtype
    pathid
    index
    secfunctions
    vendor
    ...

(subject to discussion, add, change)

NASR could work closely with RATS on the standardization of above attributes and means of proving them.


## Requirement 3: Path Attestation Procedures

After a path is selected, it should be

  1. commited to prevent changes,
  2. publicized for common referencing and retrival.

The stored path should contain these information: unique ID, all network elements on the path, and attributes of them. (Schemas may vary depending on scenarios)

<!-- LUIGI: Why do you need a unique (universal ID)? It has to be unique in the domain NASR is used but not globally unique Internet wide... -->

<!-- PCL: You are right, it should be within a domain... Adding.  -->

TBA


# Non-Requirements {#no-req}

## Non-Requirements 1: Proof-of-Non-Transit (PONT) Mechanisms

Proof-of-Non-Transit (PONT) is a proof that a packet did NOT transit certain network elements. It is to the opposite to the Req. 1 Proof-of-Transit. Certain customers requested PONT for compliance or security purposes.

First of all, PONT is a non-inclusion proof, and such non-existence proof cannot be directly given.
Second, under certain circumstances, PONT can be _inferred_ from POT. For example, assume devices are perfectly secure and their behaviors completely compliant to expectations, then POT over A-B-C indicates the packet did not transit X/Y/Z. To relax the security assumptions, if the devices are remote attested and such claim is proved by POT, then the packet _should_ only transited these trusted devices, assuming the RATS procedure is secure. The reliability of such reasoning decreases as the security level of device decreases.

NASR mailing list has agreed NOT to provide PONT mechanisms, but could provide some informational measures and conditions that could indicate PONT from POT results. For example, under xxx constraints and circumstances, if traffic passed X AND Y (device or geolocation), then it did NOT (or with a quantifiable low probability it did not) pass Z.

Since this part is research-related, NASR will work with PANRG and Academia for counseling.


## Future Requirement 2: Packet Steering and Preventive Mechanisms

In sensitive data routing use case, it is certainly necessary to know and verify the transit path of a packet using POT mechanisms. However, it might be too late to have the data already exposed to the insecure devices and risk leakage. There should be packet steering mechanisms or other preventive measures that help traffic stay in the desired path. For example, doing an egress check before sending to the next hop, preventing sending packet to a device with a non-desirable attribute.

The mailing list and side meeting has received requests to this requirement, it should fall in NASR interest, but also agreed this may not be part of the initial scope of NASR-- it is a topic to be included in the next stage of NASR when rechartering.


# Commonly Asked Questions and Answers

(From side meeting and mailing list feedbacks, to be updated)

## Why not use static routing?

Static routing severely limits the scalability and flexibility for performance optimizations and reconfigurations. Flexible orchestration of paths will be prohibited. Also, even static routing is used, we still need proof of transit for compliance check.

## Initially targeting for intra-domain or inter-domain scenario?

<!--LUIGI: Why not using "limited domains" RFC8799? (at least initially)-->

<!-- PCL: Good idea -->

## Does tunneling solve the problem?


## Does all nodes on the path need to compute the POT?

Whether the validation is strict or loose is dependent on the scenario. For example in SFC use case, we are only interested in verifying some important elements of interes processed the traffic.
